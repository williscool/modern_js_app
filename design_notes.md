# Photos App

## p0 

- readme also update this as you go along
- vanilla js only (preprocessors, and polyfills are cool though)
- photos from an api (hard code to something pretty like islands "", maybe use graphql make that p1 if it takes more than15 mins to figure out) 
- Update the UI of a page without refreshing (see more, and search for another type, maybe 300 ~ms after keystroke)
- sass
- grid (want this to be css grid)
- light box when photo clicked (just need to animate the css to the demisions of the thing based on the size of the viewport)
- Build a polished user experience you'd be proud to ship (lint, test [acceptance at least], doc, etc.)
- acceptance test with: phantomjs, chrome, firefox, safari, (I would do all N-1)
- Your submission must run without errors in the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge.

## p1

- tracking (for view count, how many times they scroll the infinite scroll, buttons clicked, images moused over or whatever stuff you can think to track. pusedocode sending it to api. just console .log it out	)
- minification of css, js, html
- you can search for whatever type of photos you want

## todo

- sass
- use css grids and some hard coded images to get the grid 
- use css animations to get the lightbox working
- wire up fetch to the api
- cross browser testing



## clarify

- I can use babel to transpile es6 correct?
- Do the browser requirements  mean that I can explicitly exclude support for ie11?
- does the prompt exclude flow type annotations (somewhat ambigious since these would be preprocessed out)




## done

- setup babel, webpack,  etc. and get an html that loads some js
